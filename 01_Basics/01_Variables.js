/*
js initially had var used as way to declare variables but
it had function scope, can be used anywhere in the funtion,
, thus a change to it will change it everywhere,
not used anymore in modern code but still there to support
some legacy code, not removed from js, but we will use only
const and let as they have block scope {} !!! (var doesn't exist for us)
